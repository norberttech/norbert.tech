        CLI app that iterates through all markdown files in given path checking if links used in them are always valid.
        I become obsessed about improving developer experience in projects I'm working on. Most of my projects is documented in markdown syntax since
        it's easy, can be easily converted to HTML but event without that it's still human readable. Keeping url's up to date
        was always my biggest nightmare, that's how MD Link Linter was created.

    <p class="mb-2">
        In order to make it even more flexible I created <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/norberttech/md-link-linter" target="_blank">docker image</a>
        that can be used just like in example below:
    </p>
<pre class="mb-2"><code class="code-shell p-0.5" {{ stimulus_controller('syntax_highlight') }}">docker pull norberttech/md-link-linter
docker run -t --rm -v $PWD:/app norberttech/md-link-linter --exclude=vendor --exclude=node_modules .
</code></pre>

    <p class="mb-2">
        Those 2 simple CLI commands can be executed at any operating system with <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> installed.
        First one will download the image, second will execute it in the current folder, passing additional arguments to exclude `vendor` and `node_modules` folders from inspections.
